Copy the '/cgi/SimplyImages' folder and contents to your cgi folder on your web host.

Set the permissions of the SimplyImages.cgi file to 755.

Modify the /cgi/templates/template.html file to suit your web page design.
The following tokens must be present in your template:
<%DirectoryTitle%> (Displays value of $DirectoryTitle from SimplyImages.cfg)
 <%directories%> (Displays a randomly chosen thumbnail image from each directory)
<%ImagesTitle%> (Displays value of $ImagesTitle from SimplyImages.cfg)
<%images%> (Displays all images in a chosen directory)
<%ImageTitle%> (Displays value of $ImageTitle from SimplyImages.cfg)
<%image%> (Displays the full size image chosen)

Modify SimplyImages.cfg to suit your taste.

To show the images in a series of folders on your web host, use a starting URL of:
http://www.yoursite.com/cgi/SimplyImages/SimplyImages.cgi?dir=../../photos

Note the '../../photos' directory is relative to the SimplyImages.cgi script

The photos directory must contain one or more folders containing nothing but image files.
See the included photos folder for an example.

The name of the folders and the name of the image files should be descriptive as they will be displayed below the image itself.

This script can be used to show the contents of an unlimited number of directories.
